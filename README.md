## Installation

Installation is easy! I'll make a more in depth installation method for different modded clients as they are requested but for now, we're just sticking with Vencord.


### Vencord

1. Copy this link:
```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinnyTerr/better-badges/main/BetterBadges(BD).theme.css```

2. Open settings > themes then online themes at the top.

3. Paste the link into the box

**Method 2**
1. Open this link:
```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinnyTerr/better-badges/main/BetterBadges(BD).theme.css```

2. Copy the text and go to settings > themes then open themes folder button.

3. Make sure that show file name extentions are (in file explorer, at the top, hit view then check view file name extentions)on and create a new text file

4. Change the name of the text file to `BetterBadges.css` including removing the `.txt` from the end

5. Open said file with notepad or prefered editor and paste the text from step 1/2

6. Open vencord and it should be underneath the open themes folder button

- **Main Description**
I am not the inital creator of this but decided to take it out of read only from [mr_minor here](https://github.com/mr-miner1/Better-Badges). Do not expect me to know everything there is as I have just started out and this seems like a good idea for my css.
